That final rule implements provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) related to the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Specifically, the final rule includes provisions related to State plan requirements and plan administration, coverage and benefits, eligibility and enrollment, enrollee financial responsibility, strategic planning, substitution of coverage, program integrity, certain allowable waivers, and applicant and enrollee protections. This final rule also implements the provisions of sections 4911 and 4912 of the BBA, which amended title XIX of the Social Security Act to expand State options for coverage of children under the Medicaid program. In addition, this final rule makes technical corrections to subparts B and F of 42 CFR part 457. The effective date of that rule, which would have been April 11, 2001, is now June 11, 2001.

The final rule implements the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), as modified by the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 (PDA), and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act). FDA is further delaying the effective date for certain requirements in the PDMA final rule relating to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs by distributors that are not authorized distributors of record, and distribution of blood derivatives by entities that meet the definition of a ``health care entity'' in the final rule. In the Federal Register of May 3, 2000 (65 FR 25639), the agency previously delayed until October 1, 2001, the effective date of these requirements. The other provisions of the final rule became effective on December 4, 2000. The agency is taking this action to address concerns about the requirements raised by affected parties. FDA believes that this further delay of the effective date of certain requirements in the PDMA final rule satisfies the memorandum of January 20, 2001, from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled ``Regulatory Review Plan,'' published in the Federal Register on January 24, 2001 (66 FR 7702). That memorandum requested Federal agencies to delay by 60 days the effective date of any regulation that was not effective as of January 20, 2001. The action taken in this document to further delay the effective date of certain requirements of PDMA exceeds 60 days. To the extent that 5 U.S.C. 553 applies to this action, it is exempt from notice and comment because it constitutes a rule of procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Alternatively, the agency's implementation of this action without opportunity for public comment, effective immediately upon publication today in the Federal Register, is based on the good cause exceptions in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). Seeking public comment is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. As explained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section entitled ``Need to Further Delay the Effective Date,'' the delay will give distributors additional time to exhaust inventories of drugs that do not have acceptable pedigrees to avoid economic harm.

However, on January 15, 2009, HUD published a final rule that delayed the effective date of the definition of ``required use'' from January 16, 2009, to April 16, 2009, due to litigation by the National Association of Home Builders, et al., around the time of issuance of the final rule.
